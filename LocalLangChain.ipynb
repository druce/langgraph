In the first stage, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments in the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplasts. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas, while also generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are essential for the second stage of photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions. The produced glucose can then be utilized by plants for growth, reproduction, and other metabolic processes or stored as starch for later use.\n",

       " Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose or other sugars. This complex biochemical reaction occurs primarily within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts found in plant cells.\n",
       "\n",
       "During photosynthesis, plants use carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), along with sunlight energy, to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen gas (O2). The overall chemical equation for this process can be represented as:\n",

       "6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2\n",
       "\n",
       "Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). In the first stage, sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments in the thylakoid membranes within the chloroplasts. This energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen ions and oxygen gas, while also generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), which are essential for the second stage of photosynthesis.\n",

       "In the light-independent reactions or Calvin cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose through a series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions. The produced glucose can then be utilized by plants for growth, reproduction, and other metabolic processes or stored as starch for later use.\n",
